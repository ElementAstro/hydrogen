Please update the existing test files to align with the latest implementation changes in the codebase. Ensure comprehensive test coverage by:

1. First, identify which implementation files have been recently modified or added
2. Review the current test files to understand the existing test structure and coverage
3. Update existing tests that may be broken due to implementation changes
4. Add new test cases to cover any new functionality, edge cases, or code paths that aren't currently tested
5. Verify that all critical functions, methods, and classes have appropriate unit tests
6. Ensure integration tests cover the main workflows and interactions between components
7. Run the updated tests to confirm they pass and provide meaningful coverage

Focus on maintaining or improving the current test coverage percentage while ensuring tests are maintainable and accurately reflect the current implementation behavior.
