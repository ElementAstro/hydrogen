Build the hydrogen project completely using XMake with the following configuration flags: --tests=y --examples=y --ssl=y --compression=y. Follow a systematic approach to identify and fix all build errors that occur during the compilation process. For each error encountered:

1. Analyze the specific error message and identify the root cause
2. Implement the necessary fixes (missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, code issues, etc.)
3. Verify the fix by attempting to build again
4. Continue this fix-and-verify cycle until the entire project builds successfully

Ensure that all components of the project (main library, tests, examples) compile without errors and that all enabled features (SSL, compression) are properly configured and functional. Document any significant issues encountered and their solutions for future reference.
