Please update the project documentation to reflect the latest implementation changes. Specifically:

1. Review the current codebase to identify recent changes, new features, or modified functionality
2. Update all relevant documentation files (README.md, API docs, user guides, etc.) to accurately reflect these changes
3. Ensure documentation completeness by:
   - Adding documentation for any new features or APIs
   - Updating existing documentation that may be outdated
   - Removing documentation for deprecated or removed features
   - Verifying that code examples in documentation still work with the current implementation
4. Check that the documentation structure is logical and comprehensive
5. Ensure consistency in formatting, terminology, and style across all documentation files

Please focus on making the documentation accurate, up-to-date, and complete so that users and developers can easily understand and work with the current version of the project.
