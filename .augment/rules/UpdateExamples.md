Please update the code examples to align with the latest implementation changes in the codebase. Ensure that:

1. All examples reflect the current API, method signatures, and class structures
2. Examples demonstrate complete usage scenarios, not just partial code snippets
3. All major features and use cases are covered by examples
4. Examples include proper error handling and edge cases where applicable
5. Code examples are tested and verified to work with the current implementation
6. Documentation examples match the actual behavior of the code

Please identify which specific examples need updating by:
- Comparing existing examples against the current codebase implementation
- Finding any deprecated methods, changed parameters, or modified return types
- Ensuring examples cover all public APIs and important functionality
- Verifying that examples follow current best practices and coding standards

Focus on making the examples comprehensive, accurate, and useful for developers who want to understand how to properly use the code.
