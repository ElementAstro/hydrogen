Run all tests in the project and fix any failing tests or errors that are discovered. Please follow these steps:

1. First, identify the testing framework and test structure used in this project
2. Run the complete test suite to get a comprehensive overview of all test results
3. For each failing test:
   - Analyze the error message and stack trace to understand the root cause
   - Examine the relevant code that is being tested
   - Make the necessary code changes to fix the underlying issue
   - Re-run the specific test to verify the fix works
4. After fixing individual tests, run the full test suite again to ensure no regressions were introduced
5. Provide a summary of what was fixed and confirm that all tests are now passing

If there are different types of tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.), please run and fix all categories. If you encounter any issues with the testing setup itself or need clarification about expected behavior, please ask for guidance.
