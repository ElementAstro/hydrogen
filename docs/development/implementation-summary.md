- Handles feature conflicts and dependencies
- Provides clear feedback on feature status
- Enables conditional compilation

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Comprehensive platform support including:
- Windows (MSVC, MinGW)
- Linux (GCC, Clang)
- macOS (Apple Clang)
- Automatic platform-specific configuration

## Impact Assessment
