## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architectural Consistency

**Design Principles**:
- Follow existing `IServerInterface` and `IProtocolHandler` patterns
- Maintain factory pattern usage for object creation
- Use consistent configuration management approaches
- Preserve existing error handling patterns while enhancing them
- Maintain thread safety and concurrency patterns

**Integration Approach**:
- Extend existing interfaces rather than replacing them
- Use composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Follow established naming conventions and code organization

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Connection Management**:
```cpp
// Connection pooling implementation
class ConnectionPool {
    std::queue<std::shared_ptr<Connection>> availableConnections_;
    std::unordered_set<std::shared_ptr<Connection>> activeConnections_;
    std::mutex poolMutex_;
    std::condition_variable poolCondition_;
    
public:
    std::shared_ptr<Connection> acquireConnection(std::chrono::milliseconds timeout);
    void releaseConnection(std::shared_ptr<Connection> connection);
    void maintainPool();
};
```

**Message Batching**:
```cpp
// Message batching for improved throughput
class MessageBatcher {
    std::vector<Message> batch_;
    std::mutex batchMutex_;
    std::chrono::milliseconds batchTimeout_{100};
    size_t maxBatchSize_{50};
    
public:
    void addMessage(const Message& message);
    std::vector<Message> flushBatch();
    void processBatch();
};
```

**Memory Management**:
```cpp
// Memory pool for frequent allocations
template<typename T>
class MemoryPool {
    std::queue<std::unique_ptr<T>> pool_;
    std::mutex poolMutex_;
    size_t maxPoolSize_;
    
public:
    std::unique_ptr<T> acquire();
    void release(std::unique_ptr<T> object);
    void maintainPool();
};
```
