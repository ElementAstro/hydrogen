## Usage Examples

### Basic Development Workflow

```bash
# Configure with all development features
cmake -B build -S . \
  -DHYDROGEN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
  -DHYDROGEN_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DHYDROGEN_ENABLE_BASE64=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build all targets
cmake --build build

# Run tests
cmake --build build --target test

# Install for development
cmake --build build --target install
```
